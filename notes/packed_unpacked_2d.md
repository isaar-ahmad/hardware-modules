The difference between `logic [M-1:0][N-1:0] x` and `logic [M-1:0] x[N-1:0]` lies in **array packing and memory organization**. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### 1. **`logic [M-1:0][N-1:0] x`**
   - **Type**: Packed 2D array.
   - **Contiguity**: Treated as a single, contiguous block of `M × N` bits in memory.
   - **Operations**: Can be used directly in arithmetic or bitwise operations as a single vector.
   - **Indexing Order**: `[M-1:0]` is the more significant dimension, and `[N-1:0]` is the less significant.
     - Example: If `x` is indexed as `x[a][b]`, `a` refers to the bit in the higher-level dimension `[M-1:0]` and `b` to the lower `[N-1:0]`.

   ```systemverilog
   logic [3:0][7:0] x; // Packed array of 32 bits
   x[3][7] = 1;        // Access bit [31]
   ```

### 2. **`logic [M-1:0] x[N-1:0]`**
   - **Type**: Unpacked array of packed elements.
   - **Contiguity**: Treated as an array of `N` independent `M`-bit packed vectors.
   - **Operations**: Each element (e.g., `x[i]`) can be used independently in operations. Requires explicit looping for operations across the array.
   - **Indexing Order**: `[N-1:0]` is the higher-level (outer) dimension, and `[M-1:0]` is the lower-level (inner) dimension.
     - Example: If `x` is indexed as `x[a][b]`, `a` selects one of the `N` vectors, and `b` refers to a bit within that vector.

   ```systemverilog
   logic [3:0] x[7:0]; // Unpacked array: 8 elements, each 4 bits
   x[7][3] = 1;        // Access bit [3] of the 7th element
   ```

### Key Differences:

| **Aspect**             | **`logic [M-1:0][N-1:0] x` (Packed)** | **`logic [M-1:0] x[N-1:0]` (Unpacked)**  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Storage**            | Contiguous `M × N` bits              | Array of `N` independent `M`-bit vectors |
| **Arithmetic Operations** | Can apply to the whole array        | Operates element by element              |
| **Indexing**           | `x[i][j]`: `i` -> `[M-1:0]`, `j` -> `[N-1:0]` | `x[i][j]`: `i` -> array, `j` -> vector   |
| **Contiguity in Memory**| Fully packed in memory               | Unpacked in memory, elements are distinct|

### When to Use:
- Use **`logic [M-1:0][N-1:0]`** when you need a contiguous block of bits, especially for operations like slicing or passing the array as a single vector.
- Use **`logic [M-1:0] x[N-1:0]`** when working with arrays of independent elements (e.g., FIFOs, memory banks).
